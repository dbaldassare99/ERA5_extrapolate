Extrapolate Future Hadley cell width based on reanalysis trends from satellite era

Currently uses two methods of estimating Hadley cell width from reanalysis: zonal mean zonal wind zero-crossing, meridional
stream function zero-crossing

Other methods can be added from PyTropD as needed

Future projection based off linear fit of satellite era, considers uncertainty of slope and intercept
